With generics we can create general purpose classes and methods that can work with DIFFERENT TYPES of OBJECTS.
    > generic classes/methods
Generics are very common in Java. A lot of built in classes and interfaces in Java are generic.

When we compile a generic class, the Java compiler will erase the generic type parameter and replace it with an actual
class.

We can apply constraints using the

        > this will ensure that we can only use the given TYPE or its SUBTYPES as a generic type argument.
