    > Functional programming
         > Its one of the many programming paradigms or styles of programming that makes implementing certain tasks
         really easy and robust.

    Lambda expression

    In this section we are going to talk about
        > lambda expressions
        > functional interfaces
        > consumers
        > suppliers
        > functions
        > predicates

        These building blocks are extremely important. They are used a lot in real world applications. And we are going
        to continue using them throughout the rest of this course. Make sure to master them before going further.
