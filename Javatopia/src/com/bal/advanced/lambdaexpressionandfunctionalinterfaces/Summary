- Lambda Expression
  - like anonymous functions that we can pass
    - functional interfaces
      - is an interface with a single abstract method
        - we can use to represent a function
          - in java four different types of functional interfaces
            - consumers
            - suppliers
            - functions
            - predicates
              - we can compose these interfaces to build more complex functions
