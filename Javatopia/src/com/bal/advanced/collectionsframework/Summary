We use the
    > COLLECTION interface to represent
        > a collection of objects to support
            > add
            > remove
            > get operations
In a collection, we cannot access elements by their
    > INDEX

This LIST interface
    > extends the collection interface and gives us that additional functionality

The QUEUE interface represent a queue  of objects.
    > We use ques to process jobs in the order we receive them

The SET interface represents a UNIQUE list of values

The MAP interface represents a set of key value pairs
