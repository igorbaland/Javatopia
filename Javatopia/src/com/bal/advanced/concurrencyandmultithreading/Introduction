Most computers these days days have multi core processors
  which can execute many tasks in parallel
In this section, we are going to learn
  how to write code that can leverage these multi core processors.
    this makes your application
      faster and more responsive
We will start this section with a quick overview of
  KEY TERMS AND CONCEPTS
    such as processes and threads. We will talk about
    WORKING WITH THREADS
      starting
      interrupting
      pausing threads
We will look at
  CONCURRENCY ISSUES
    such as race conditions and visibility problems.
      These are the issues that can exist in all concurrent systems.
        They are not specific to Java. We look at this problems and
          then will learn various strategies to prevent them.
  SYNCHRONIZATION
  VOLATILE FIELDS
  ATOMIC OBJECTS
