    /*
    OOP is about objects. These objects interact with each other to perform various tasks. As analogy think about a
    car. Car consists of hundreds or thousands of collaborating objects. Almost all these objects are reusable and
    replaceable. So if any of them malfunction, a technician can put it out and replace it with another object.
    Applications built using object oriented programming techniques are exactly the same.

    Benefits:
    > Reduced Complexity
        > breaking down a large complex application into smaller, more manageable and easier to maintain objects
    > Easier Maintenance
        > if an object is not working properly, we can only focus on the code of that object, not the entire application
          we can either fix that object or plug in a different object as a replacement
    > Code Reuse
        > Once we build and test an object, we can use it in other application.
          For example, let's say we are building an image editing application. In this application we're going to give
          our users various filters  to use their photos. Once we build these filters, then we can reuse them in other
          image editing applications. And this means we are going to spend less time to building applications.
