    Coupling is about how much a class is dependent upon or coupled to another class

    Metaphor
    you use your phone, u have coupled to your phone. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but the more you use your
    phone, the more your dependent on it. If you use your phone every single minute for different reasons, you are
    really dependent on it. Now, if I take that phone from you , you are going to have a difficult time living.

    The same concept in object in OOP. We want to reduce the coupling between classes. There is no so such thing as no
    coupling or 0 coupling, there is always coupling because all these classes we create they should work together to
    perform some tasks. We just want to aim to reduce the coupling.

    Example
    Class A is using Class B. It's dependent upon or couple to this class. Now if we change class b, class a may have to
    be modified, or else it has to be compiled and also any other classes that are dependent on class a may have to be
    modified or at least recompiled. That's not a big issue, when we have only two classes in our application. But in
    a real complex application, you might have thousands of classes. You don't want to change one class and end up with
    100 broken classes. This the problem with coupling. The more our classes are coupled to each other, the more costly
    our changes are going to be. So by reducing the coupling we can reduce the impact of changes.
