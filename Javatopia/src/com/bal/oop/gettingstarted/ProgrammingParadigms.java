    In OOP, everything is based on the concept of objects. These objects are units that contain some
    Data (State) and operations on the data also called method (behavior). These are the methods or functions that
    modify the data. In OOP, you bring together, data and methods (behavior) that operate on a single object.

    In FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING, we take the opposite approach, we assume that data and behavior are fundamentally
    different, so we keep them separate. This is completely different style of programming

    You can solve the same problem using both these paradigms, your code will end up looking different.

    OOP
    > is difficult to understand/learn
    > is Complex
    > most books and courses out there fail to explain it properly

    - it depends on the problem  you're trying to solve. One of the major issues we have in the software industry
    these days is that developers are more excited about languages, tools and frameworks than solving problems

    Problem Solving
    Process of DEFINING A PROBLEM, identifying and comparing DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS, and picking the one that the best
    solves that problem to the CONTEXT and CONSTRAINTS.
    die das Problem je nach Kontext und Einschränkungen am besten löst.
    A lot of developers out there dismiss the context and constraints, and they see things as black or white.
    They have their favourite languages and tools, and they use them for every single problem

    Which style is better?
    depends on the:
    - problem
    - context
    - budget
    don't fall in love with one solution and apply it to every single problem
