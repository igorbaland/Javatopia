Working with threads is complex and error prone.
  Java 5 introduced higher level abstractions
    that simplify building concurrent applications.
      With this abstraction we don't need to explicitly work with threads.
        Instead, we focus on our tasks and let Java take care of thread manipulation.
In this section we will be talking about
  thread pools
  executors
  callable and future interfaces
  asynchronous programming
  completable futures
