    Abstraction reduce complexity by hiding unnecessary details in our classes
    Unfortunately this one of the most misunderstood concepts in OOP

    A metaphor:
    think of the remote control of your tv. This remote control has a bunch of buttons that allow you to work with tv.
    Inside this remote control, we have the electronic board, a bunch of transistors and so on... Now here is the
    thing, we don't directly to work with these transistors, there are the implementation detail. There's so much
    complexity there, we don't really understand that and we don't want to understand that. All we want to do is to
    change the channel of our TV. We don't care what happens under the hood. We don't care what state this transistor
    is going.
    This is abstraction in action. So with abstraction we want to hide the implementation detail of the class and treat
    it like a black box. We don't care what's inside, we just have a simple interface to work with. Just like the
    buttons on a remote control.
