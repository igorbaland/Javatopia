    //very important to keep our code CLEAN and ORGANIZED.

    //just like our houses. If your house is messy and full  of stuff all over the place -
    // you're going to have a difficult time looking  for something you're looking for.

    //In Contrast, if your house is clean, everything is in the right place, you can quickly
    //find your stuff.

    //the exact same concept in coding. As our programs grow larger, we have to break down our code into smaller chunks,
    // these chunks are
    // > easier to read and understand
    // > reuse them in other programs
    // > The programms written this way are more maintainable and easier to extend

    //
